Jump-start your next presentation using a GitPitch markdown
presentation template.

Each branch in this repo contains a self-contained, GitPitch
markdown presentation template. Out-of-the-box each template
gives you:

- A distinctive theme
- Attractive typeface and imagery
- Sample [custom CSS](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Custom-CSS) styling
- Sample [custom Settings](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Settings) configuration
- Sample slide background images
- And sample markdown that demonstrates a wide range of [GitPitch features](https://gitpitch.com/features.html).

While you focus on your content, presentation templates
ensure your content is delivered as beautifully rendered, fully
responsive, online and offline slideshow presentations. But whenever you want more control of the visual appearance of your slides, every aspect of the template is customizable by you.

## Presentation Templates Gallery

Start by visiting the official GitPitch Presentation Gallery [here](https://gitpitch.com/templates).

The Gallery gives you *live-preview* and *one-click* download for every template. Once you download a *template-bundle* just commit and push the files found in the bundle to your own Git repo and you instantly have a fully functioning GitPitch presentation.

Alternatively, you can *fork* or *clone* this entire repository and then simply checkout the *branch* for the template you want to use in order to quickstart your next presentation. 


Remember to *watch* this repo so you are notified
when new templates are added or existing templates
are updated.

## Presentation Template Images

All images used within these templates were gifted by the world’s
most generous community of photographers, see [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

This free collection of beautiful images is a great resource for any
GitPitch presentation author. Please remember to minimize your image
assets before adding them to your Git repo. The highest quality,
free image optimization service I have found online is [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). 

These are just personal recommendations, I have no affiliation with 
either service.
